# My Quantitative Methods Repository

Here, I will store all the necessary files for the Quantitative Methods course. Mainly, they will be programs to aid me in the necessary calculations. All programs were created by me, except one, which for obvious reasons is not included here. For all matrix calculations, I used a Matrix Library for the Lua Programming Language, which was developed by Github user davidm.

Any important comments will be added to this README file.
